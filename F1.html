                <h2>Formula 1 Data Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Analysis of Formula 1 Racing Data</p>
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project involves analyzing Formula 1 racing data to gain insights into race performance and driver statistics. The goal is to explore various aspects such as lap times, driver performance, and race outcomes using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. The analysis includes identifying key performance indicators, predicting race outcomes, and uncovering trends in driver and team performance.</p>

                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How can we predict race outcomes based on historical performance data?</li>
                    <li>What factors most significantly affect lap times and race results?</li>
                    <li>Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in driver performance over the seasons?</li>
                    <li>How do different teams compare in terms of race performance and consistency?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, R</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> pandas, numpy</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> sklearn, XGBoost</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> scipy, statsmodels</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analysis and Techniques</h3>
                <p>The analysis employed various statistical and machine learning techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Used to predict race outcomes and lap times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Applied to classify race results (e.g., win/loss).</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Trees and Random Forests:</strong> Identified important features affecting race performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouped races or drivers based on performance metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Analyzed trends in driver performance over time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcomes and Insights</h3>
                <p>The analysis provided valuable insights into race performance, including factors affecting lap times and race outcomes. Key drivers and teams were identified based on their performance trends, and predictive models successfully forecasted race results. These insights can help teams and drivers optimize their strategies and improve their performance in future races.</p>
