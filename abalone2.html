                <h2>Abalone Dataset Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Analysis of Abalone Dataset</p>
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project involves analyzing the Abalone dataset, which includes physical measurements of marine snails. The objective is to explore and predict various attributes such as age and sex using statistical and machine learning models. The analysis addresses key research questions through methods like regression analysis, decision trees, clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).</p>

                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How well can we predict the age of an abalone based on its physical measurements?</li>
                    <li>Is there any significance between age and sex?</li>
                    <li>Is there any significant relation between gender of the abalone and other physical parameters?</li>
                    <li>Identify distinct groups of abalone based on similar characteristics.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, R</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> pandas, numpy</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> sklearn, clustMixType</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> scipy, statsmodels</li>
                    <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> PCA</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analysis and Techniques</h3>
                <p>The analysis employed various statistical and machine learning techniques:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Used to predict age based on physical measurements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polynomial Regression:</strong> Applied to capture non-linear relationships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong> Reduced dimensionality and addressed multicollinearity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Tree and Random Forest:</strong> Classify sex based on physical attributes and evaluate variable importance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chi-Square Test:</strong> Examined the relationship between age and sex.</li>
                    <li><strong>K-Prototypes Clustering:</strong> Identified distinct groups of abalone based on physical characteristics and sex.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcomes and Insights</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed significant relationships between age and sex, and demonstrated the ability to predict age from physical measurements. It also successfully classified abalone sex based on physical attributes and identified distinct groups using clustering techniques. These findings enhance understanding of abalone biology and have practical implications for marine biology and resource management.</p>
