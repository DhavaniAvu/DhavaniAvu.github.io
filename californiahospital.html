                <h2>Hospital Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Analysis of Hospital Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings</p>
                
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project involves analyzing the California Hospital Inpatient Mortality Rates and Quality Ratings dataset. The analysis aims to investigate the relationship between hospital quality ratings, risk-adjusted mortality rates, and geographical location. By exploring these aspects, the project seeks to provide insights into hospital performance and identify potential areas for improvement.</p>

                <h3>Data Overview</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Number of Hospitals:</strong> 384</li>
                    <li><strong>Average Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rate:</strong> 5.90797</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Research Questions and Findings</h3>
                
                <h4>1st Research Question</h4>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are hospitals with higher quality ratings more likely to have lower risk-adjusted mortality rates for specific procedures/conditions?</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Using Python, the analysis involves plotting data for hospital ratings, mortality rates, and procedures. Mean risk-adjusted mortality rates are calculated based on quality ratings.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Generally, hospitals with higher quality ratings are associated with lower risk-adjusted mortality rates. However, exceptions exist where some high-rated hospitals have higher mortality rates for certain procedures.</p>

                <h4>2nd Research Question</h4>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any hospitals in California that consistently have higher or lower mortality rates than the statewide average for a particular procedure/condition?</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Using R, the dataset is filtered for California hospitals. The average risk-adjusted mortality rate for each procedure/condition is compared with statewide averages.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Some hospitals consistently have higher or lower mortality rates compared to the state average. Plots show the distribution of hospitals by comparison category.</p>

                <h4>3rd Research Question</h4>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any relationship between the geographical location of a hospital and its risk-adjusted mortality rate for specific procedures/conditions?</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Using R, scatterplots and regression models are used to explore the relationship between hospital location (latitude and longitude) and risk-adjusted mortality rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Findings:</strong> A weak correlation is found between geographical location and mortality rates. Regression analysis shows a statistically significant relationship, though the R-squared value is low.</p>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, R</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> pandas, numpy</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> matplotlib, seaborn, Tableau</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> scipy, statsmodels</li>
                    <li><strong>Regression Analysis:</strong> Regression models in R</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overall Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dataset is specific to California hospitals.</li>
                    <li>Data is self-reported and may include errors or biases.</li>
                    <li>Limited number of variables.</li>
                    <li>Data covers a limited time frame.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The analysis reveals a correlation between hospital quality ratings and risk-adjusted mortality rates. Higher-rated hospitals generally have lower mortality rates, though there are exceptions. Geographical location shows a weak relationship with mortality rates. The findings emphasize the importance of considering additional factors beyond geographical location and quality ratings in assessing hospital performance.</p>

                <h3>Implications and Future Research</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus on quality ratings and geographical disparities in hospital performance.</li>
                    <li>Investigate other factors like staffing levels and patient demographics.</li>
                    <li>Explore the impact of quality improvement programs and policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Acknowledgment</h3>
