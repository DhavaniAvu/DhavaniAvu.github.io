                <h2>Abalone Age Prediction</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Predicting the Age of Abalones Using Machine Learning Techniques</p>
                
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on predicting the age of abalones based on physical measurements. The dataset used contains several features, including length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, shell weight, and rings. The number of rings plus 1.5 gives the age in years. The aim was to build a model that accurately predicts the age of abalones using these features.</p>
                
                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> pandas, numpy</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> seaborn, matplotlib</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> sklearn</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Analysis and Techniques</h3>
                <p>The project included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning models. I explored various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict the age of abalones. The models were evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error and root mean square error.</p>

                <h3>Outcomes and Insights</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed significant features that influence the age of abalones, with the Random Forest model providing the most accurate predictions. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems involving complex datasets.</p>
