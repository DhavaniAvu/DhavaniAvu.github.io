                <h2>Credit Card Account Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Analysis of Credit Card Account Closures</p>
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>This project focuses on analyzing factors influencing credit card account closures to improve customer retention strategies. The goal was to identify key variables associated with account closures, evaluate model performance, and make actionable recommendations to the bank for reducing customer churn.</p>

                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What factors are associated with customers closing their credit card accounts?</li>
                    <li>Can we predict whether a customer will close their account? If so, how accurate are the predictions?</li>
                    <li>What actions or policies can the bank implement to reduce the risk of losing customers?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> R</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> dplyr, tidyr</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> logistic regression, decision trees, random forests</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> ROC curve, accuracy, AUC-ROC</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> ggplot2</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analysis and Techniques</h3>
                <p>The analysis involved several models to predict credit card account closures and assess their performance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> Identified key variables influencing account closures and demonstrated a model accuracy of 80% with a ROC AUC above the baseline.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Tree:</strong> Provided insights into decision points affecting account closures, with a high accuracy of 89.35% and a ROC AUC of 91.51% across cross-validation folds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Forest:</strong> Achieved a high accuracy of 95.06% and a ROC AUC of 98.96%, showcasing robust performance and minimal need for hyperparameter tuning.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcomes and Insights</h3>
                <p>The analysis revealed several factors associated with credit card account closures, including part-time employment status, card type, frequency of customer care contacts, utilization ratio, and total spending. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the Random Forest model providing the highest accuracy and ROC AUC. Key recommendations include targeted retention strategies for part-time employees, enhancing card benefits, proactive customer service, and promoting card usage.</p>

                <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Retention for Part-Time Employees:</strong> Develop personalized strategies to address the unique needs of part-time employees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhance "Blue" Card Benefits:</strong> Improve benefits and features of the "blue" card to reduce closure rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proactive Customer Service:</strong> Implement solutions to address frequent customer service interactions and prevent dissatisfaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promote Card Utilization:</strong> Launch campaigns to increase card usage with incentives and rewards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimize Credit Limit Management:</strong> Dynamically manage credit limits based on individual behavior and creditworthiness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Periodic Card Feature Enhancement:</strong> Regularly review and enhance card features to stay competitive and retain customers.</li>
                </ul>
