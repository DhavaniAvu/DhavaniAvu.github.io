                <h2>License Management and Security Log Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> License Management and Security Log Analysis for Multi-Project Compliance and Efficiency at Wipro</p>
                
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>The project aimed to create a centralized system for managing software licenses across Wipro's multiple projects. This system was designed to reduce costs, improve compliance with software vendor agreements, and streamline license allocation based on demand.</p>
                
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>My role involved extracting license data from various sources and developing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare the data for analysis and visualization. I handled data retrieval, transformation, and loading into a centralized repository for comprehensive analysis.</p>
                
                <h3>Project Workflow and Contributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Extraction:</strong> Retrieved data from license servers, project management systems, and application logs. Used Pythonâ€™s <code>re</code> library for parsing logs and <code>requests</code> for API data extraction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Applied data cleaning and normalization with <code>pandas</code>, standardized formats, and created a common schema across all sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Loading Process:</strong> Loaded transformed data into a SQL database for analysis, implementing incremental loading to maintain data freshness without full re-imports.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, SQL</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Processing Libraries:</strong> pandas, re, requests</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Tableau, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
                    <li><strong>ETL Automation:</strong> Python scripts for scheduled tasks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Challenges Encountered</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Complexity:</strong> Ensuring consistency across varied formats (unstructured logs, structured databases) required extensive cleaning and normalization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handling Large Volumes:</strong> Optimized log parsing and batched processing to manage high volumes of log data.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Outcomes and Impact</h3>
                <p>The project led to significant cost savings through license reallocation and ensured compliance with software agreements, reducing the risk of penalties. Our ETL pipeline provided timely, accurate insights for decision-making by Wipro's project managers and leadership.</p>
