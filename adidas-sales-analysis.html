                <h2>Adidas Sales Analysis</h2>
                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Advanced Data Analysis and Time Series Forecasting</p>
                <h3>About the Project</h3>
                <p>In this project, I aimed to utilize advanced data analytics techniques to explore, analyze, and predict patterns in a given dataset. The focus was on implementing various statistical and machine learning models to derive meaningful insights and forecast future trends. A significant component of this project was time series analysis, which involved building models to predict future values based on historical data.</p>
                
                <h3>Tools and Technologies Used</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Manipulation and Analysis:</strong> pandas, numpy</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> seaborn, matplotlib</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> scipy, statsmodels</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> sklearn</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> pmdarima</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Analysis and Techniques</h3>
                <p>The project included various phases such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. I applied machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to understand the factors impacting sales performance. For time series forecasting, ARIMA and SARIMAX models were implemented to predict future sales trends accurately.</p>

                <h3>Outcomes and Insights</h3>
                <p>The analysis provided insights into sales patterns, seasonal trends, and key factors influencing sales. The forecasting models offered a reliable prediction mechanism that could assist in decision-making and strategy formulation for the company's sales team.</p>
